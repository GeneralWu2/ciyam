Dear Mr. Knowles,

I hope you are doing well. We recently came across your post about FARTCOIN on the Bitcoin forum and would like to request a brief meeting with you. We have already sent you an email regarding this.

We would also like to properly credit you in connection with a Solana-based token named $FART, and to arrange for you to receive all rewards associated with the project.

We apologize for the interruption and appreciate your time. Wishing you a pleasant day, and we look forward to your response.
